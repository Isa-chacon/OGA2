            <p>
                Minimize the education gap for sexual and reproductive health for individuals who 
menstruate by promoting sexual and reproductive education to destigmatize 
menstruation, challenge social taboos surrounding menstruation, and sexual life

            <h2>2.Menstrual products</h2>
            <p>
                Ensure access to the material people who menstruate biologically and medically need by 
                promoting campaigns that free menstrual products. The ideal is focusing on nondisposable menstrual products such like menstrual disk/cup but the majority people who 
                menstruate are not familiarized with these products or do not feel comfortable using 
                them. Despite the fact this is a good alternative because these products remain for a few 
                years, we also need to consider that they are more expensive than disposable menstrual 
                products.

            <h2>3.Accompaniment</h2>
            <p>
                This will support this community by allowing those who menstruate to be comfortable and empowered 
                so that they can achieve their own personal goals and hopefully help those around them.

            <h2>4. Spread the impact</h2>
            <p>
                The ideal is to spread the impact by leaving behind a training protocol as well as sanitary 
            supplies, aim for sustainable products like discs and cups, there is a lifeline for the 
            community to share and exchange knowledge with one another and help to end the period 
of poverty within that community. We want people who participate in this initiative to 
become trained to trainers so the impact cand transcends and we can create a social 
network of support and teaching about menstruation and reproductive rights and sexual 
education.
